	README - Brief description of the directory layout and files needed
*******************************************************************************


This directory has the following layout :

./
	amm_master_qsys_with_pcie	- Synthesis/Simulation files for Qsys module. Needs to be a part of your quartus project.
	linux_app_sample		- Software to use your FPGA design
	exm_avalon_mm_master_templates	- Template files. Not of specific use for users.
	ip				- Not of specific use to users.
	<bunch of other files>		- Explained below

<bunch of other files>
1. EP4CGX150DF31.qsf 	- This is a pin assignment file to be used in your
quartus project.  Very imporant file.
2. SEG_HEX.v	    	- Design file
3. amm_master_qsys_with_pcie.qsys - Qsys file for the internals of your
design.
4. master_example.qpf 	- This is the main Quartus Project File. 
5. master_example.sdc 	- Design Contraints file for timing analysis in Quartus.
6. master_example.sv  	- Top level netlist (FPGA wrapper)
7. user_logic.sv	- This is the top level design file for the custom
user logic. If you have multiple design files/partitions make sure this is what
interacts with the registers and SDRAM.
